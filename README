To run a session similar to those on 
http://www.thumbtack.com/challenges, simply ruin Main.py

Note that this uses a deferred writer, so that responses to 
commands are suppressed until you send "END" at which point,
the entire output is written to screen.

Example session:

SET a 50
BEGIN
GET a
SET a 60
BEGIN
UNSET a
GET a
ROLLBACK
GET a
COMMIT
GET a
END
50
NULL
60
60


Note that there is no prompt symbol (as in the sample input/output),
but one can be specified when creating the DatabaseManager.

The following DatabaseManager:
DBM = DatabaseManager.DatabaseManager(GENERIC_DB, '>>> ')

produces the following session (same as above)

>>> SET a 50
>>> BEGIN
>>> GET a
50
>>> SET a 60
>>> BEGIN
>>> UNSET a
>>> GET a
NULL
>>> ROLLBACK
>>> GET a
60
>>> COMMIT
>>> GET a
60
>>> END
